# GWChange

Just a simple batch script that I made in my spare time. Feel free to use it.

## Requirements

In order to run this program, you need at least GNOME v42.5.

## Usage

As a batch script

```
bash gwchange.sh -d <path/to/your/wallpapers/folder> -s <time_in_seconds>
```

Alternatively, you can make it executable

```
chmod +x gwchange.sh
```

Then execute it like this

```
./gwchange.sh -d <path/to/your/wallpapers/folder> -s <time_in_seconds>
```
